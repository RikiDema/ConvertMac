Convert Macbook-pro-15 years 2010 to portable computer ARM 

Things still to do: 

1) Remove original motherboard, battery and cd-rom
2) using the schematics to reverse engineer the pcb, find the connections for the trackpad and keyboard  
3) design new motherboard with arm cpu (you think of a raspberry or more performing cpu)
4) create a battery management system (insert a more powerful, larger and lighter battery)
5) create the circuit to control the monitor 
6) create the circuit to control keyboard backlight
7) create the circuit to control the internal and external audio 
8) reconstruct input output circuit usb, sd, displayport, ethernet, wire internal camera usb 
9) add a sata-to-usb or sata-to-pci-e controller for the internal hard drive
